# Check if an object is a character vector

Differs from [`is_character_vector()`](is_character_vector.md) in that
it permits glue character vectors to pass.

is_character_vector_or_glue(x)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  An object to check.

## Value

A logical value indicating whether `x` is a character vector or glue
vector.
